        It was great to see [name] recently. I have summarised the main points

      </p>

      <p>
        Given the time that has elapsed since our meeting I have updated the
        valuation that I gave you and I have enclosed a copy for your records. I
        will send over the regulatory documents such as the costs and charges
        report and the wealth statement in due course which detail the
        suitability of the underlying investment risk we are taking with your

      <h2>Financial Objectives</h2>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Summarize the key points related to the client's overall
        financial goals with regards to factors like property ownership and
        post-tax income. Outline the measures that would lead to the client's
        desired financial outcomes and goals.}
      </p>
      <p>
        As I have mentioned in the past, the key to your finances is to ensure
        that you remain financially independent. This will continue to be
        achieved through owning the property in which you wish to live and
        having an income after tax that is greater than your budgeted
        expenditure.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Outline the client's plans regarding residence, property
        sales, and potential purchases, if any. Highlight considerations such as
        property values and dependencies on economic factors like interest
        rates.}
      </p>
      <p>
        From a property perspective, you intend to reside at [location] for the
        next two years and then will look to move. You plan to sell the house as
        well as the [location] flat and in turn purchase a larger family home in
        the [location]. You think that you will look for a property worth c.£1.8
        million but this will depend on interest rates.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Emphasise on the importance of considering annual
        expenditure and the factors that significantly affect it like location
        of residency and spending preferences to determine financial
        tolerances.}
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to regularly consider your annual expenditure in detail
        to enable you to make informed decisions. Where you live and how much
        you want to spend will dictate the tolerances of your finances. We have
        historically worked on an estimate of £60,000 as your core, annual
        expenditure which you said should be raised slightly to £65/£70,000 p.a.
        I note that this does not include your mortgage repayments or nursery
        fees. You expect BAV to pick up the nursery fees, but you haven’t yet
        discussed the timing of this with your parents.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Highlight any significant upcoming expenses like tax bills
        or potential investment-related transactions and provide the details.
        Outline the plans for handling these financial events.}
      </p>
      <p>
        You have no large expenditure items on the horizon except for a £7,500
        tax bill which will be paid from [] cash. In addition, [] sold a small
        stake of [] and as a result will have a CGT bill to pay in January 2025.
        How much this will be and what you will do with the monies due to HMRC
        will be discussed later this summer when you have received the sale
        proceeds.
      </p>

      <h2>Current Financial Position</h2>
      <h3>Cash & Income</h3>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Advise on the general importance of a cash emergency fund
        worth of atleast six months that would cover core expenditure.
        Acknowledge the client's current financial situation and conclude on the
        adequacy of the client's emergency fund with regards to his/her
        circumstances and preferences.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Whilst it varies from client to client, we would generally recommend
        that clients retain a cash emergency fund of at least six months’ worth
        of core expenditure to avoid having to draw upon invested assets to fund
        short term liabilities. You currently retain a cash balance of £42,500
        (£35,000 after the tax payment) which is sufficient for your
        circumstances and is an amount which you are comfortable with.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Validate the client's income details, considering any
        bonuses and dividend payouts. Correct any discrepancies if mentioned.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I set out your income in the meeting agenda and you pointed out that
        your base income is £140,000 not £240,000, I have amended our records
        accordingly. You had a bonus this tax year of £135,000 although your
        remuneration package is changing from April with your base salary rising
        to £165,000, your bonus will be c.£100,000 and £75,000 will be paid out
        as dividends.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Generate financial details about the client's spouse, if
        any. Validate the spouse's employment status and income sources and if
        not mentioned, convey appreciation if the details are provided, allowing
        for a more complete record.}
      </p>
      <p>
        [] mentioned that is [] unlikely to go back to work for at least a year
        but if you have any more children then it could be much longer than
        this. Currently [] is employed by her father and receives an income for
        this. I do not have any details of this and would be grateful if you
        could provide me with the level of income so our records are complete.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Discuss the client's rental property income, if any,
        considering impact on mortgage payments, expenses like taxes and fees,
        and potential plans.}
      </p>
      <p>
        The rental property income covers the mortgage payments, taxes and fees
        but doesn’t produce a profit beyond this and as mentioned above, will
        likely be sold in a couple of years.
      </p>

      <h3>Investments</h3>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Discuss potential options for utilizing any remaining tax
        allowances in the current fiscal year and mention any allowances that
        have been utilized or remains available in the current tax year. Suggest
        considering funding from the main portfolio to enhance tax efficiency.
        Ask for the client's preference in this matter.}
      </p>
      <p>
        [] ISA allowance has been utilised in the current tax year although []
        £20,000 allowance remains available. This could be funded from [] main
        portfolio and would improve the tax efficiency of your investments
        whilst making use of allowances available to you. Please do let [] know
        if you would like to do this.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Inform the client about any allowance availabilites for
        the upcoming tax year and mention the numbers. Inform the client on any
        relevant updates on the allowances. If there are any capital gains from
        previous transactions, outline the numbers and the importance of
        declaring gains on the tax return.}
      </p>
      <p>
        [] full CGT allowance for the 2023/24 tax year is available and as you
        are aware this has now reduced to £6,000. Alongside any CGT payable from
        the JH&P portfolio last tax year, [] you also sold 1% of your business
        in the 2022/23 tax year which created a gain that will need to be
        declared on your tax return.
      </p>

      <h3>Pensions</h3>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Provide guidance on optimizing pension contributions for
        the current tax year based on individual circumstances. Iterate the
        rationale behind the client's decision if the client had already made a
        decision on an action to take regarding pension contributions.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Since our meeting and due to the tax year end, we discussed the
        rationale for you both making further pension contributions in the
        2022/23 tax year. You ultimately decided that neither of you would make
        any further contributions as you wished to stay as liquid as possible
        with your mortgage rate likely to rise next year.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Review the client's historical pension contributions and
        allowances, highlighting any over-contributions and their implications.
        Explain the impact of the use of unused pension allowances from previous
        years.}
      </p>
      <p>
        [], as I explained in our subsequent conversation, given you had already
        over contributed in the 2019/20 tax year you had no unused pension
        allowances available from that year and so you would lose nothing by not
        making further contributions in the 2022/23 tax year. This is because
        you are allowed to use unused allowances from the previous three tax
        years.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Discuss the client's potential to maximize pension
        contributions within the revised annual allowance and employer
        contribution limits.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Given your earnings are now likely to fully taper your annual allowance
        over the coming years, we should look to make the maximum contributions.
        As you are aware, the Spring Budget has raised the maximum annual
        allowance for someone fully tapered in the 2023/24 tax year from £4,000
        to £10,000 and so your employer contributions should be capped at this
        amount.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Address discrepancies in pension-related records, if any,
        suggesting collaboration with the accountant for proper resolution.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically this cap was not changed to reflect the previous change to
        the capped amount from £10,000 to £4,000. I raised this discrepancy with
        you having reviewed your tax returns and there were additional
        abnormalities. I suggest you raise these with your accountant to ensure
        these are recorded and I am happy to go through the issues with you
        prior to any communication if that would be helpful.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Provide recommendations on optimizing pension transfers
        and contributions, exploring alternatives for more efficient approaches.
        Assess whether the alternatives are feasible and guide the client in the
        right direction in reaching the decision.}
      </p>
      <p>
        You are keen to transfer as much of the Aviva scheme into your Curtis
        Banks SIPP as possible and I will write to you under separate cover with
        my recommendation on this. This is a regular exercise that is done and a
        more efficient way of managing the process may be to redirect the
        contributions made to your employer pension to your Curtis Banks SIPP,
        if possible. Whether this is an option will depend on your company’s
        policy but given your seniority may well be doable and is certainly
        worth asking your HR department about.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Evaluate the suitability of the existing pension scheme,
        considering the client's objectives and potential contributions. Mention
        any contribution numbers when evaluating the pension scheme.}
      </p>
      <p>
        [] your People’s pension scheme remains appropriate for your objectives
        and where possible we should continue to make the annual maximum pension
        contribution into the scheme. The amount you can contribute will vary
        depending on when you return to work with the maximum being £3,600 gross
        if you have no earnings in the tax year.
      </p>

      <h3>Capacity for loss</h3>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Analyze the client's cashflow page to assess the current
        holdings in lower volatility assets, emphasizing their role in meeting
        short-term capital needs without selling equities.}
      </p>
      <p>
        As you can see from the cashflow page on the enclosed valuation you are
        currently holding £117,938 in lower volatility assets which equates to
        under two years’ worth of core expenditure. In the event of requiring
        capital at short notice, holding lower volatility assets means you would
        not be forced to sell equities should it be an inopportune time in the
        market to raise funds.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Consider the client's overall allocation of lower
        volatility assets, and acknowledge equities in funds that may impact it.
        Discuss the surplus income over expenditure to limit the need for
        immediate fund access.}
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality you hold a higher level of lower volatility assets than this
        but because your non-pension investments are held in our unitised
        Harrier funds which also holds equities, we have not included these in
        this calculation. We discussed that your strong income over expenditure
        surplus means that your cash should be constantly topped up and it is
        highly likely you won’t need to access your investments for a number of
        years.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Discuss the role of non-pension investments as part of the
        emergency buffer. Highlight the Balanced risk approach in non-pension
        investments, such as GIA and ISA.}
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, given you cannot access your pensions for a number of years
        your investments do act as part of your emergency buffer and it is for
        this reason that []’s GIA and ISA are invested in the Balanced approach
        to risk. []s ISA is essentially treated as a pension for long term
        savings and this is reflected in the higher approach to risk taken.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Provide an overall assessment of the client's capacity for
        loss and assess whether the risk the client is taking across portfolios
        is feasible. Request the client to refer to the Wealth Statement for a
        full breakdown of the investment risk profiles.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I am comfortable that due to [] annual income, you have
        suitable capacity of loss across your investments and you can afford to
        be taking the level of risk you currently are across your portfolios.
        Please refer to the Wealth Statement for the full breakdown of your
        investment risk profiles.

      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Review the current estate for potential inheritance tax
        liability. Declare whether mitigation needs to prioritized, based on the
        current life stage.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Your estate currently has a potential inheritance tax liability however,
        given your stage of life mitigating against this is not a priority.

      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Review the details of a bare trust, if any, and iterate
        the discussed details including a reflection of any invested

      <p>
        [] parents are in the process of opening up a bare trust for [] but this
        will not be funded by either of you. Her JISA remains invested in the
        Harrier Adventurous fund in reflection of her long-term investment
        horizon and the £9,000 allowance will be funded later in the tax year.

      </p>
      <p>
        You confirmed that you have still not looked at your wills but that it
        was on your list. I would be happy to make an introduction to who offer
        a good service for a relatively competitive rate.
      </p>
      <p class="instruction">
        Instruction: {Seek confirmation regarding whether or not a LPA (Lasting
        Powers of Attorney) is already in place and emphasize the importance of
        addressing this matter, even if not a priority at the current life
        stage.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I would be grateful if you could confirm whether or not you have LPAs in
        place. Whilst putting in place lasting powers of attorney may not be a
        priority given your stage of life; they tend to be associated with later
        life issues, it is important that we mention them and continue to review
        this as part of our ongoing advice.

        maintain liquidity and access to your funds in light of your upcoming
        mortgage renewal, current level of income should more than cover this
        off. It would be tax efficient where possible to continue making use of
